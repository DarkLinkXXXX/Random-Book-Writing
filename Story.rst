Kikaku was just coming home from school, but something seemed... different. THe streets were more quiet, and people weren't talking as much as they used to.
Black showed the same anxiety, walking beside Jhonny, "Trippy." he twitches slightly, "Weird."

The brothers then came to their house to find that there was no one in it, but there was a note on the front door.
Black hops forward a few steps, snatching it off the door, "Uhh.. Well, I just found out I was adopted." he snorts, "Half adopted, ohh wow, how is that possible..?"

"I know. You were adopted by your father with his ex-girlfriend, before he divorced and remarried." He replied.

"Ohh well. Back in Black, I hate to say it!" he jumps off of the porch with a stomp, "I've got nine lives and ten size." he sings, stomping his feet on the ground, putting the volume on his ipod all the way up, "Back!" he stomps his feet on the ground as he dances to the music, completely immature as always when he listens to music. He does the air guitar for a few moments.

"You and silly classic rock." Kikaku snorted. "If it doesn't have wubs, it no good."

"I love classic. Baby make it hurt so good! Sometimes love don't feel like it should, so baby make it hurt so good." Black grins.

Kikaku meanwhile just played Happy Violence (topnot remix) and a boombox he just pulled out of nowhere.

"Come on! Make it hurt so good!" Black sings, changing the song to Some Nights.

Kikaku sighs. "Let's just go inside and make some grub. I'm starving."

Black nods, turning off the song, checking something for a moment, "Hmm. Serephera texted me. She's really nice."

"Are you two still dating?" Kikaku asked.

"We're a couple, thank you very much."

"All right. By the way, I'm happy for you." He said, lying through his teeth.

Black grins, "Ahh, I remember the first time we made out."

**"SHUT UP BLACK!"**

Black flinches, "Okay, sheesh. Why so mad?"

"Umm, no reason. Let's just prepare something to eat." Kikaku said evasively, before starting to prepare some top-ramen.

Black snorts, texting Serephera, sitting at the table.

Kikaku was like a chef. Sure, these people were on their own, but Kikaku somehow learned how to make real fucking ramen. This wasn't the top-ramen shit that poor people buy in a store, it was actual ramen noodles with actual pork with actual fucking miso sauce. If only he wan't so lazy, he could probably start a store or something.

Black finally sets his ipod down, "Kikaku, I wanna marry her. I love her."

"Were legally adults, so technically you could, but don't you think Junior High is a bit early to start making decisions like this?"

Black sighs, "I love her." he fiddles with his belt for awhile, not making eye contact.

It was Kikaku's turn to sigh. "Just like you loved that purple-haird banshee that took advantage of you."

Black twitches, "Advantage? She tied me to the bed."

"Exactly."


"And gagged me. Shheeeeessshh. That was no fun."

"And who invited such a sadistic woman to his house?"

"Me."

"That's kind of an extreme example, but I'm just saying, I don't think you should go through with this until you know for sure for what love is. You've barely started puberty for chris sakes!"

"I'm 15! I've had all that jazz, I'm a man."

"No, you're not. I know because I can hear you humping your bed every night, but you never need to clean the sheets. Either you don't need to, or you're just plain filthy!"

Black just stands, stalking off to the living room, "I'm a man."

Kikaku just lightly shook his head out of view. *'Is this how every 18 year old feels lecturing his little brother?'* He thought.

Black runs into his room a moment later, slamming the door shut, opening it for a moment, "Tell me when the food is ready." he closes the door again and jumps on his bed, studying the sheets, pulling them off, walking out of his room, dragging them behind him, "See? They need to be washed!"

Kikaku just facepalmed. This was ridciculous, Nevertheless, he persevered, but in a different direction. "You do know bathing in your own jizz causes urinary tract infection right?"

"It's not piss. It's...." Black blinks at him, "Whatever. I guess I'll never be a man now." he throws his sheets on the ground and stomps off, into the living room, "I should just-"

He hit him on the head with a heavy book. "And don't you dare go suicidal on me either! Your life is not worth ending simply because you have less patience than a wolf!"

Black rubs his head, "Ow. Go see the sheets yourself, at least I don't shower in white sticky stuff, like you do."

It took all of his willpower to do so, but Kikaku resisted the urge to redicule his 
brother even further. He's already done it enough.

Man, he made it so easy though.

Black shifts, "I don't even know the name for it! I'm that stupid!" he pouts, and doesn't meet Kikaku's gaze.

*'He doesn't even know the name for it. Is he that stupid?'* Kikaku thought.

Black stands there, completely unable to say anything else, "Are you going to be a good brother and tell me what it's called?"

"What what's called"

Black groans in frustration, "You know exactly what I'm talking about!"

"Semen, seed, jizz, man-milk, pick one." 

"Come." he says, "Come. I'll call it come."

"Yeah, you can call it cum too."

"Because it comes when you... come." He says, hoping he's correct, "Jizz. Jizz is better."
