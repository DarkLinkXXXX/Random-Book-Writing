Kikaku was just coming home from school, but something seemed... different. THe streets were more quiet, and people weren't talking as much as they used to.
Black showed the same anxiety, walking beside Jhonny, "Trippy." he twitches slightly, "Weird."

The brothers then came to their house to find that there was no one in it, but there was a note on the front door.
Black hops forward a few steps, snatching it off the door, "Uhh.. Well, I just found out I was adopted." he snorts, "Half adopted, ohh wow, how is that possible..?"

"I know. You were adopted by your father with his ex-girlfriend, before he divorced and remarried." He replied.

"Ohh well. Back in Black, I hate to say it!" he jumps off of the porch with a stomp, "I've got nine lives and ten size." he sings, stomping his feet on the ground, putting the volume on his ipod all the way up, "Back!" he stomps his feet on the ground as he dances to the music, completely immature as always when he listens to music. He does the air guitar for a few moments.

"You and silly classic rock." Kikaku snorted. "If it doesn't have wubs, it no good."

"I love classic. Baby make it hurt so good! Sometimes love don't feel like it should, so baby make it hurt so good." Black grins.

Kikaku meanwhile just played Happy Violence (topnot remix) and a boombox he just pulled out of nowhere.

"Come on! Make it hurt so good!" Black sings, changing the song to Some Nights.
